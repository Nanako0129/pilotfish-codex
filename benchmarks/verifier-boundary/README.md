# Verifier-boundary Gate

## Result

Both passing controls used the README-documented opt-in:
`Use pilotfish and delegate eligible work to the named agents.`

| Control | Observed routing | Acceptance | Client-reported cost |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Schema migration (2 of 2 attempts fully reproduced on the shipped bytes with no added rule — see `determinism`) | `plan-verifier` → explicit approval stop → `mech-executor` → primary tests → fresh `verifier` | `READY`; no pre-approval writes; only `store.mjs` and `store.test.mjs`; `CONFIRMED` | $2.42460000 |
| Routine docs | Direct main-session edit; no Agent call | 1/1 test; only the requested README typo changed | $0.25360000 |
| Post-cap Plan control | `plan-verifier` × 3 | `REVISE` → `REVISE` → material ownership fix/new epoch → closing `READY`; zero writes | $1.16110000 |

The `mech-executor` hop above is a recorded historical route, not a schema Gate requirement. The current [issue #29 recovery Gate](../spontaneous-dispatch/README.md#issue-29-opt-in-recovery) requires Plan review, approval, primary tests, and outcome review; implementation ownership follows the dispatch brake and is recorded rather than forced.

The exact candidate therefore reached both sides of the independent-review
boundary under explicit agent opt-in: the serialization change received Plan
and outcome review, routine docs stayed direct, and a user-directed three-turn
Plan control stopped after two `REVISE` verdicts before one closing check.
Every Agent call omitted an invocation-level model override. The main session
and both review roles resolved to Opus 5; `mech-executor` resolved to Sonnet 5.

The current passing controls reported $3.83951475 against the v1.3.7 compressed policy. The schema cell fully reproduced on 2 of 2 attempts against the shipped bytes. Two failure modes seen on earlier byte revisions did not recur and remain under `failed_attempts` as historical context. Including the earlier candidate Gate, the disclosed
operator-policy failure, the zero-cost quota failure, the non-reproducing schema
attempt, and the diagnostic that the weekly limit truncated, the full campaign
reported $29.8355; `results.json` carries the breakdown.

This is not a cue-free claim. On this tested Claude Code account, a
higher-priority operator contract prohibited Agent calls unless the user
requested them. A neutral schema prompt therefore edited the fixture directly
and was rejected as Gate evidence. The run cost $0.51322950 and is retained in
[`results.json`](./results.json), along with the earlier zero-cost 429 attempt.

## Exact inputs

| Input | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| [`gate-snapshot-v2/CLAUDE.md`](./gate-snapshot-v2/CLAUDE.md) | `b26ef4a6a0e02575a39ecc8d3303a8cd7f9e9180548311de399fff527efb3b75` |
| [`gate-snapshot-v2/agents.json`](./gate-snapshot-v2/agents.json), file bytes | `e6257911a02c805147d7d8923eae14877cc8e29089e85ac93b544f5afb73ea3f` |
| `agents.json`, shell-normalized runtime input | `b5dc352f526f0c6f1985c67799f547c3368b2b72e77be1738a8789c542ae7bfc` |

The disposable baseline is under [`fixture/`](./fixture/). Exact neutral and
explicit prompts are under [`prompts/`](./prompts/). `results.json` binds every
prompt and raw stream by hash and records the final artifact hashes, route,
cost, completion, and acceptance evidence.

[`gate-snapshot/`](./gate-snapshot/) preserves the first passing candidate
before the follow-up verifier prompt correction. It remains historical evidence
and is not the current installable payload.

## Reproduction

Create separate disposable Git copies of `fixture/` for the schema and routine
controls, copy `gate-snapshot-v2/CLAUDE.md` into each repository root, and commit
the clean baseline. Then run:

> **What the recorded runs actually tracked.** The commands below pass
> `gate-snapshot-v2/agents.json` to `--agents` without copying it into the
> repository, which is the shape a fresh reproduction should use. The runs
> recorded in [`results.json`](./results.json) under `passing_gate` did copy and
> commit it: their baseline tree is
> `fd81141c7bb17fdf9c688150b7dde2cb9f4afd40`, which tracks `agents.json`
> alongside `CLAUDE.md` and the four fixture files. Reproducing with the block
> below therefore yields a different baseline tree from the recorded one. This
> matters when the recorded runs are used as one arm of a comparison — see
> `cue_free.pro_arms_share_one_tree` in
> [`../spontaneous-dispatch/results.json`](../spontaneous-dispatch/results.json),
> where both compared arms share this exact tree and the file is a constant of
> the comparison rather than a difference between its arms.

```

Run the routine control in a fresh disposable copy with a new session ID,
`--max-budget-usd 4`, and
[`routine-docs-explicit.txt`](./prompts/routine-docs-explicit.txt).
Run the three `plan-cap-turn-*.txt` prompts in order in another clean copy,
using one new session ID, then `--resume` for turns 2 and 3.
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is limited to these disposable fixtures.
